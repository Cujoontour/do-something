1) please describe the problem:
- which piece of equipment is broken? ideally link its wiki page here!
- do you know what may cause the problem?
- is there anything helpful in the manual (link in the corresponding wiki infobox, if available)?
- what have you done to fix it so far? any further ideas that you haven't tried yet?

2) please make this issue visible after opening it to "warn" others about the downtime and perhaps recruit helpers for a quick repair:
- send a quick note over the [mailing list](https://wiki.comakingspace.de/Mailing_List)
- link the issue from the tool's wiki page
- apply issue labels (on the right), e.g. "electronics" if you think people with electronics skills are needed to fix this

3) oh, and please delete everything of this template that is not needed for solving the issue ;-)
